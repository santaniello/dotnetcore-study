# Publishing an application (framework-dependent deployment)

Execute the command below:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```
The console output indicates to which folder the binaries are published.

There should be four files:

-  hwapp.deps.json
-  hwapp.dll
-  hwapp.pdb
-  hwapp.runtimeconfig.json

Copy these files to another machine that has the .NET Core SDK installed. Then, to
execute the application, run the command dotnet hwapp.dll from the folder con-
taining the copied files.

In this example, only the binaries built for the project, and any included packages,
are published. This is called a framework-dependent deployment. When you deploy the
files from the publish folder, you need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on the tar-
get machine.

To execute the application, just:

```bash
dotnet hwapp.dll
```

# Publishing a Self-Contained Application (You don't need to have the SDK installed)

To create a self-contained application, youâ€™ll first need to be explicit about what
runtimes your application can run on. This is done by adding the Runtime-
Identifiers property to your project file, as shown in the following listing.


```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
      <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
      <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
      <RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64;osx.10.11-x64;linuxmint.19.1-x64
      </RuntimeIdentifiers>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now you can create a self-contained application by using the runtime identifier in the
publish command, as follows:


```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r linuxmint.19.1-x64
```

To execute the application, just:

```bash
dotnet hwapp.dll
```

# Deploying to a Docker container

## Console Application

First, you need create a Dockerfile:


```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1
COPY bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/publish/ /root/
ENTRYPOINT dotnet /root/hwapp.dll
```

After, we need build the image:

```bash
docker build -t hwapp .
```

After, execute:

```bash
docker run -it hwapp
```
